# WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE EXECUTING THIS SCRIPT
################################################################################

# DESCRIPTION:  The script 'plot4.R', constructs and saves a multiplot,
#               that presents some core aspects of the changes in emissions
#               over time, only for coal combustion-related sources,
#               across the United States.

# THE QUESTION: The plot tries to answer the question:
#
#                   Across the United States, how have emissions from coal
#                   combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008? 

# WORK-FLOW:    The script executes the following STEPS:
#                 1. Downloads and extracts the data files if any of them don't exist.
#                 2. Loads the data files in R.
#                 3. Process the data to isolate the target variables and observations.
#                 4. Creates 'utility functions' to help in data wrangling.
#                 5. Creates a list with instruction to construct all elementary plots.
#                 6. Constructs all elementary plots that compose the multiplot.
#                 7. Combines the plots, to create each part of the multiplot.
#                 8. Combines the parts, to create the multiplot
#                    and saves it in the working directory.

# ABOUT THE DATA USED
# The data used to create the plot,
# comes from the 'National Emissions Inventory (NEI)' database.
# Specifically the tables below were used:
#     - 'PM2.5 Emissions Data' (summarySCC_PM25.rds)
#     - 'Source Classification Code Table' (Source_Classification_Code.rds)
# which can be downloaded from 'UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository' through this link:
#     "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip"
# The script will download the data files, if any of them doesn't exists in the working directory.
# More informations on the dataset can be found on the link:
#     https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-inventories
